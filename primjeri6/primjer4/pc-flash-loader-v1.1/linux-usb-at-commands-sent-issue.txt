Stupid modems…

Well, after some debugging I’ve discovered that the device keeps receiving “
AT+xxx”. This are AT commands used in modem devices and are sent from my

sudo vi /etc/udev/rules.d/44-stlink.rules

Add the following line:
	
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0483", ATTRS{idProduct}=="5740", \
    MODE:="0666", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1"\
    SYMLINK+="stlinkv2_%n"
    
Restart udev:
>> sudo udevadm control --reload-rules

I’ve checked again with wireshark and eventually everything works as expected! There is always something to learn…
